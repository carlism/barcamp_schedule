This is a scheduling app for managing a one-day barcamp or other sort of user-driven/open convention.

TO-DO:

* Extend for a multi-day event
* Improve security around the admin pages
* Add an all-comments page
* Add drag and drop to schedule/admin view for rearranging the presentations
* Add timeblocks for showing "Planning" and or "Lunch" in the scheduler

Twitter integration ideas:

* Add links to display text.  Link @user words to twitter.com/user and #tags to search.twitter.com/search?q=tags
* Add #tag suggestions per presentation, ie. #bcp_40
* Investigate background tasks to search twitter for #bcp_nn type tags and post them to the presentation comments
